# Meg Bucich — Portfolio

**Applied Mathematics (SDSU ’26)**  

This portfolio is **actively being updated** with new projects. This highlights the theory I have gather during my four years of undergrad and my applied skills I have learned during my graduate program. Here on display is my ability to analyze real-world data, communicate results clearly, and apply mathematics to practical problems. 

**Contents Summary**
- In this portfolio there are contents from python and R, the main interfaces used in my graduate program. There will soon be Excel, SQL, Power BI and Tableau projects.
- Python: Content includes material learned from control theory, programming in mathematics, numerical matrix analysis, and computational numerical optimization.
- R: Used to do regression analysis and singular value decomposition, along with other content from linear algebra and applied linear regression models.
